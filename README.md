Considering the system as a state machine,
This software simulator
was built
to experiment with inputs acting via algorithms on the NxN data structure.
This gives an n by n table, where n is the number of neurons in the system.
 some cells accommodate the states of the neurons, but more importantly, there are cells providing for the state of the synaptic dependency of each neuron on every other neuron.

One cybernetic function performed by an algorithm operating on the NxN data structure is to <i>remember the paths the neuron inputs take through the input configuration space</i>
