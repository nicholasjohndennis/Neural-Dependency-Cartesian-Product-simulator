The NxN model abstracts a natural neural system to a state machine.
This gives the NxN data structure, an n by n table, where n is the number of neurons in the system. Some cells accommodate the states of the neurons, but more importantly, there are cells providing for the state of the synaptic dependency of each neuron on every other neuron.
This software simulator was built to experiment with inputs acting via algorithms on the this data structure.
The operation of the simulator sets some synaptic cells to the potentiated state in a particular pattern.
When this pattern is interpreted correctly, the cybernetic function performed by this algorithm is to <i>remember the paths the neuron inputs take through the input configuration space</i>
