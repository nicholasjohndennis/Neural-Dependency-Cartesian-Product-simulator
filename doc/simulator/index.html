This shows a diagram of the simulator components and state dependencies between them.

Setup
<p>
0) when index.html is clicked, the GUI shows inputs where the user can specify the layout parameters.
<br>1) When the Generate button is clicked, the driver Layout generator is called, which
<br>2) sets up the NxN data structure, neuron outputs and Input Generator as html elements, according to the specified layout parameters.
</p>
Navigation
<p>
3) as the mouse is moved over a GUI NxN element,
<br>4) the driver Navigation code is called to highlight the element and it's associated elements.
</p>
Simulation
<p>
5) edit Names for the inputs.
<br>6) edit the rows of the Input Generator each with a pattern of input values, so the rows represent the dynamics of the Inputs.
<br>On the left,
<br>7) Apply the Input Generator rows in sequence, so the Input dynamics are presented to NxN.
<br>Each Apply calls the Engine, which:
<br>- copies the generator input pattern to the NxN neurons.
<br>- then emulates the parallel operation of natural neural systems by making 2 passes over the NxN, scanning all the synapses on each pass
and calling the Algorithm module for each synapse. This emulates the uniformity of operation of the neurons in a natural neural systems.
<br>- the Algorithm sets the states of the input and output sides of the synapse.

<br> Click the Reset button to set the Output, NxN and Input Generator values to null.
